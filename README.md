# Task Tracking Application


This project is a task tracking application developed to ensure effective management of tasks and projects. Users can manage projects, tasks, users, comments, and notifications. Project, .NET 8 and Entity Framework Core have been developed using and are equipped with a variety of modern technologies and techniques.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Autofac 8.1.0**: It is a library used for dependency injection.
- **Entity Framework Core**: it is the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library used for eritaban operations.
- **FluentValidation**: It is a library used for data validation.
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: It is an approach used to parse common operations in different parts of the code.
- **Interceptors**: It is a technique used to change or add application behavior using AOP.
- **MemoryCache**: Provides in-memory caching mechanism.
- **Transaction Management**: Provides process management for database operations.
- **Performance Aspects**: Apply various techniques on the application to improve performance.
- **SOLID Prensipleri**: It consists of five basic principles used to ensure that software is flexible, sustainable and extensible.
